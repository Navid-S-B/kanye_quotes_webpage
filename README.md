# Random Kanye Quotes Webpage
This is a fun little project I got onto doing to delve into web development,
and start learning the basics of frontend and backend development utilising html, css,
js and python!

The webpage essentially sends an API get request to gather kanye quotes using an AWS Lambda function
through an HTTP API through the "**Get Yeezin'**" button. With the "**Get Preachin'**" button, it creates a tab to a Kanye
YouTube playlist.

This project has taught me so far on how basic HTML webpages can be structured, how css is used
to style the page (position of images, created text boxes, animinating buttons etc.), how js can be integrated to
add functionality to objects on a page (i.e. buttons), and how to connect the webpage to the backend using
an API to send Kanye quotes.

This is still an on going project, as I have plans to expand the website to almost cover all of the basics
of frontend development!

**TO NOTE:**<br />
I do not condone nor support everyone of Kanye's comments. I am just a fan of
his music back in the 2000s and early 2010s :).

## How does it work?
